Time: $O\!\(n \log\log n\)$,\quad Space: $O\!\(n\)$

The classic implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes returns a boolean array
to mark which numbers are composite or prime. The strategy consist on starting
with every number marked as prime and traversing the array linearly, marking
off as composite all multiples of prime numbers. It has a time complexity of
$O\(\displaystyle\sum_{p\text{ prime}}^n \frac{n}{p}\) = O\(n \log\log n\)$
and a space complexity of $O\(n\)$. A common optimization involves on only
traversing up to $\sqrt{n}$, although it does not change the time complexity as
$\log \sqrt{n} = \frac{1}{2}\log n$.
