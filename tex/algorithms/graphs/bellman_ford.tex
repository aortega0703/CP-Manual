Time: $O\(|V||E|\)$,\quad Space: $O(1)$.

A shortest path (with no negative weight cycles) uses at most every vertex with
no repeats (that is $|V| - 1$ edges), then to obtain the shortest distance to
all nodes we simply uptade over all $|E|$ edges $|V| - 1$ times, making the time
complexity analysis trivial. If there exists a negative weight cycle, then on an
extra $|V|$-th distances are still being updated.
